## Getting started

`npm install`: This will install all dependencies required for the project in 
the node_modules folder.

Have a look at ./testing.html as a reference for the color palette.

### NPM Commands

`npm run sass`: Monitors the sass folder for any changes, and outputs 
./dist/css/index.css.
