<p>
    Hyperledger is a set of software frameworks and tools developed by the Linux Foundation and IBM, and Hyperledger Composer is a specific framework for developing business blockchain networks. We would like to provide a workshop showing participants how to develop business blockchain networks using the Hyperledger Composer web application. All they would need is a laptop and internet connection.
