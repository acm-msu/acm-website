<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
    Are you interested in how professional programmers write software that you use in your daily life? Are you passionate about being a great software developer in the future? Well, you have come to the right place! Welcome to Tech Smith’s Tech Talk! In this talk, we are going to discuss about the ins and outs of how to write and build high standard software. We use this method, not only in our company but everywhere in the software development industry, so knowing this would help you be ahead of other new hires. Not only that, but we are also covering a lot of different aspects of making software: the organization, design, infrastructure, testing, documentation, review, and more other based on my experience in the industry.
