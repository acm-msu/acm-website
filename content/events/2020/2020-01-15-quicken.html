    "Do you dream of life as a Software Engineer who writes epic code, or maybe 
    a CEO of a non-profit building AI solutions to find a cure for cancer, or 
    maybe a CTO for a Fortune 500 company? Regardless of what your dreams are, 
    you are full of potential, probably more than you realize. This talk will 
    help you discover that potential and show you how to create a career that 
    you will love."
