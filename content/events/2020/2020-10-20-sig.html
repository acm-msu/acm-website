    Our main goal at ACM is to help create and facilitate connections between students interested in computer science. While tech talks are pretty cool and provide lots of value on their own, they aren't exactly the best environment to accomplish this goal, especially when everyone is isolated during lockdown. Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are our answer to this, and we believe it's the best way for you to become more involved in the CS community at MSU.
</p>

<p>Two Special Interest Groups that we're kickstarting this Fall are:</p>
<ul>
        <li>
                <strong>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</strong> <br>
                President: Aref Zeitoun
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>OS (Operating Systems, Devops, Tooling)</strong> <br>
                President: Cosmos
        </li>
</ul>

<p>So, why should you join a SIG?</p>
<ul>
        <li>Gain knowledge in an area of interest.</li>
        <li>Receive mentorship.</li>
        <li>Make connections with like-minded students.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with SIG members on a project.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You don't need any prior experience to a join a SIG; they exist to help you learn, and hopefully create some cool stuff along the way too.
</p>

<p>
So, are you excited to learn more and get involved?? This Wednesday, ACM is going to be hosting our first game night/SIG informational meeting. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the SIGs from each of the Presidents leading the groups, as well as how to get involved. Oh, and we'll be playing some Jackbox too.
</p>

<p>
We'll be meeting in the <strong>General voice channel on the ACM Discord server</strong> this Wednesday (10/14) at 6pm EST, and we hope you can be a part of this really cool opportunity. You won't need to buy, download, or sign up to anything to participate; just join the voice channel and we'll take care of the rest!
