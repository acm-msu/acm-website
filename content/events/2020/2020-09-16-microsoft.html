    Hey everybody, ACM has it's first 20/21 tech talk coming up next Wednesday 
    (Sept 16th), and we think you're really gonna get a lot out of this one. 
    Here's some information:<br>
    <br>
    Description: Maybe you've done group projects for a software class or even 
    an intern project, but what is it like to work on software in the real 
    world with hundreds or even thousands of engineers? How do you participate 
    in planning? How do you track your work? What makes you a good teammate 
    and partner? Find out from a software engineer and manager who worked at 
    Microsoft for 25 years and others for 15 years before that.<br>
    <br>
    Speaker: Eric Brechner recently left Microsoft after 25 years to become a 
    career coach. Eric has been a principle development manager for Azure, 
    Windows, Office, and Xbox, as well as a senior principal scientist for 
    Boeing, and engineer for Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Silicon Graphics. 
    He holds eight patents, has written two books, earned a B.S. and M.S. in 
    mathematics and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Rensselar Polytechnic 
    Institute, and was a certified performance technologist. Eric is widely 
    known within the engineering community as his alter ego I.M. Wright, and 
    is an affiliate professor at the University of Washington's Bothell 
    campus.<br>
    <br>
    We hope you'll be able to join us, and make invite some of your friends 
    too!<br>
