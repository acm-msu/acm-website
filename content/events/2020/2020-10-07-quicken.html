Being a Specialist is overrated. Working to have more knowledge than anyone else in a field in your community is keeping you from being the best you can be. Doctors and teachers should have a specialization, but most people don’t have to be experts. Having a career built on being adaptable, overcoming unpredictability, and connecting areas of knowledge for new solutions is very important in this current age of work. The key is being a Generalist or what some people call a Jack of All Trades. Being a Generalist means approaching one’s life as a creative work, living life from a creative professional, as opposed to a reactive viewpoint. This talk will bring a new view to building a career that allows you to spread your eggs in many baskets, creating more opportunities, exploring new passions, and thinking bigger than where you are today.
