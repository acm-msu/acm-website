    Principal Engineer of Microsoft’s “AI for Earth” group, Jennifer Marsman is 
    coming to MSU to talk about AI for Earth. Here is an abstract:<br>
    <br>
    The AI for Earth program applies machine learning and data science to hard 
    challenges in agriculture, water, climate, and biodiversity. 
    In this talk, we will discuss how the AI for Earth team, Microsoft 
    Research, and AI for Earth grant recipients are using machine learning to 
    enable precision agriculture, to predict outbreaks of disease, to detect 
    poachers in real time, and to classify animals for conservation.  Finally, 
    we will briefly provide details on the AI for Earth grant program to obtain 
    resources for everyone to work on these challenges.
